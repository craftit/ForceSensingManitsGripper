# Force Sensingi Mantis Gripper
Force sensing for the mantis gripper, with ROS integration and adaptor for the UR5

## The Mantis Gripper

This project takes the gripper for Andreas HÃ¶lldorfer's gripper for his Mantis robot arm and adds force sensing and ROS integration. It also contains a URDF model, collision meshes, and visual meshes for integration with ROS MoveIt! 

The information on the gripper can be found at: http://chaozlabs.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/mantis-robot-arm-part-1-gripper.html

The parts for the gripper can be downloaded from thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1480408

## Outstanding issues

- The servo motor can still overhead if left gripping an object too long. This is particularly a problem if you print the gripper parts in PLA
- Ideally it would put on a custom PCB or use an existing smart servo controller.
